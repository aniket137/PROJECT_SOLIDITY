# PROJECT_SOLIDITY

DESCRIPTION
The given Solidity code defines a smart contract called "NewToken" representing a basic token. Here's a summary of its main components:
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT: This is a comment that specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, it is using the MIT license.
pragma solidity 0.8.18: This line specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used (0.8.18 in this case).

contract NewToken: This line declares the start of the contract named "NewToken".
tokenname and tokenid: These are public variables representing the name and identifier of the token respectively. In this case, the token name is set to "DOREMON" and the token identifier is set to "DOR".
totalSupply: This is a public variable of type uint that represents the total supply of the token. It is initially set to 0.
balances: This is a mapping that associates addresses with their corresponding token balances. It maps addresses to uint values.
mint function: This function allows new tokens to be created and assigned to a specific address. It takes two parameters: _address (the address to which the tokens will be assigned) and _value (the number of tokens to be minted). The function increases the total supply by the minted value and updates the balance of the specified address accordingly.
burn function: This function allows tokens to be burned (removed) from a specific address. It takes the same parameters as the mint function. The function checks if the address has a sufficient balance to burn the specified number of tokens. If it does, it decreases the total supply by the burned value and updates the balance of the address accordingly.
